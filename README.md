# Tracking Truck

A React-based truck management system designed for efficient tracking, registration, and data management of trucks. The app allows users to record truck details, manage entries and exits, weigh loads, and view data visualizations for better operational insights.

## Features

- **Truck Registration**: Easily register trucks with details such as ID, brand, model, and license plate.
- **Automated Weighing**: Calculate the weight of trucks and loads for accurate tracking.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical insights into truck operations to improve decision-making.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface built with Material-UI for desktop and mobile compatibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI for components and styling
- **Backend**: (To be implemented or specify if using a mock API for now)
- **Data Visualization**: Libraries like Chart.js or D3.js (optional based on future enhancements)
- **Database**: (SQLite, MongoDB, or other, if applicable)
